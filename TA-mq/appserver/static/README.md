# splunk-ibm-websphere-mq-add-on - TA-mq

By Hannes Wagener - 2015 

## Overview

This is a Splunk modular input add-on for IBM Websphere MQ.
Currently two data inputs are supported.  One for creating events from messages on IBM Websphere queues and another for channel status statistics.

Created from the Splunk modular input examples.

## Features

* Simple UI based configuration via Splunk Manager
* Poll  IBM Websphere MQ queues at interval.
* Poll IBM Websphere MQ Channel Status statistics.
* Uses regular splunk sourcetypes to process message ("Generic single line", "_json" or "syslog") 
* You can specify multiple queues or channels per data input.  You can specify whether to use a thread per data input or per queue/channel.
* Automatic thread management.  No need to restart splunk after changes are made to a data input.  This includes adding and removing queues.
* Includes default response handlers for queue input and channel status input.
* Includes a response handler for IBM Websphere Message Broker monitoring events.

## Dependencies

* Splunk 6.0+
* PyMQI 1.2+
* ctypes library for Python
* IBM Websphere MQ Client Libraries V7+
* Only currently supported on Linux (but Windows (and any other platform) should be possible if the platform versions of the PyMQI and ctypes libraries are installed) 

## Setup

* Install the IBM Websphere MQ client.  
* Get and build the PyMQI library.  You can download from here: https://github.com/dsuch/pymqi 
* Untar the MQ modular input release to your $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory.
* Copy the built PyMQI library to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-mq/bin folder.
* Copy python c_types library directory to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-mq/bin directory.  
* Ensure that the pymqi and ctypes libraries can be imported when using the Splunk Python interpreter. 
* Restart Splunk

## Response Handlers
### DefaultQueueResponseHandler
* Basic handler for MQ messages.
* Supported options: 
   * `include_payload=false/true` - Include the message payload in the event.  Default: true
   * `use_mqmd_puttime=false/true` - Use the message put time as the event time.  Default: true 
   * `include_mqmd=false/true` - Include the MQMD in the event.  Default: false 
   * `pretty_mqmd=false/true` - Use textual descriptions for MQMD values. Default: true
   * `make_mqmd_printable=false/true` - Escape non text values in the MQMD.  Default: true 
   * `payload_limit=1024` - How many bytes of the payload to include in the splunk event.  Default: 1024 (1kb)  
   * `encode_payload=false/base64/hexbinary` - Encode the payload.   Default: false 
   * `make_payload_printable=false/true` - Escape non text values in the payload.  Default: true

### DefaultChannelStatusResponseHandler
* Default handler for Channel Status Statistics.
* Supported options:
  * `include_zero_values=true/false` - Include values that are set to zero or default values in the event.  Default: false
  * `textual_values=true/false` - Include the textual description for channel status parameters.  Default: true

### BrokerEventResponseHandler
* IBM Message Broker Monitoring event handler.   
* Parses a Message Broker monitoring event and extracts the required fields.  
* Supported options:
  * `include_complex_top_level = true/false` - Include the complex type top level element when logged.
  * `include_bitstream = true/false` - Include the bitstream (base64 or blob) in the splunk event.
  * `write_events = true/false` - Write out the events to disk.  
  * `gzip_events = true/false` - Gzip the events written to disk.
  * `write_events_folder = "/opt/brokerevents"` - Directory to which events must be written.  


## Logging

Any modular input log errors will get written to $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log.  Debug logging can be "enabled by changing the "ExecProcessor" property under "Server logging" to DEBUG.

## Troubleshooting

* You are using Splunk 6+
* Look for any errors in $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log
* Enable debug logging by changing the "ExecProcessor" property under "Server logging" to DEBUG.
* Ensure that the PyMQI and ctypes libraries can be imported when using the Splunk Python interpreter. 
* Ensure that the IBM Websphere MQ libraries are available to the user which runs Splunk.
